        Hi, my name is Haider Ali,
        \n\nI love making Android apps. That\'s why I am doing a course
        on Udacity - Developing Android Apps with Kotlin.
        \n\nBesides coding I love singing and hanging out with my friends.
        \n\nThe name of my College is Zakir Hussain College of Engineering
        and Technology, AMU. I am a Undergrad student there.
        \n\nThe main area of my study is Electronics and Communication
        Engineering.
        \n\nSo that was about my education background.
        \n\nI live in a city in India named as Aligarh,which is mostly
        famous for its locks industries.
        \n\n I have one brother and 3 sisters. My brother does programming
        in php, and he is currently doing a diploma in Computer Engineering
        from AMU, which will be completed in the year 2020.
        \n\nMy youngest sister has completed her masters in political science
        after which she has applied for phd and bed courses. Her attempts were unsuccessful.
        This year she has applied for NET exam also.
